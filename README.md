## What is Python?
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

According to its creator, **Guido van Rossum**,

> Python is a high-level programming language, and its core design philosophy is all about code readability and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in a few lines of code.
